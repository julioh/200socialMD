##   The Future of Money
 Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies like Dash are the future of money. Over one billion dollars of investment is expected during 2016, so they are well past the startup stage. But they haven’t even scratched the surface of the mainstream market yet.
 
 Cryptocurrency will create the next round of multibillionaires in this new economy.
 
You can secure your place in the ground floor of an opportunity that is past the risky “maybe” stage, but not fully integrated into the general population. Imagine a nearly automatic residual income stream coming in month after month. All with a “money machine” that takes up less than 4 square feet of space.
